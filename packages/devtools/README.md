## What is this?

This is a companion repo to the main Flutter repo. It contains the source code for a suite of
performance tools for Dart and Flutter. All of the core app logic is in /packages/devtools_app with package:devtools serving as just a container to publish precompiled
versions of the application for easy use with `pub global activate`.
